## Minimal Syntax Rules

You don't need much to learn how to use HDS, it uses the simple key value method. **HDS** does not support spaces for now, we recommend you use something like "\_","-" or "..". After every definition a {} is needed.

```md
{
    key = {
        value
    }
}
```

## Relationships in HDS

Relationships in HDS is pretty simple, its all like json but simple and understandable for humans.

```
{
    main-parent = {
        value-child = {
            value-child
        }
    }
}
```
