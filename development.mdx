## Building with MakeFiles

Lightd comes with a MakeFile in default. This allows developers and power users to test lightd faster. Make sure your system supports MakeFiles before we start.

### Running lightd with the MakeFile

```bash
make run
```

<Info>
Now you have installed Lightd, but let's learn how to use it! See the [Lightd API docs](/lightd)
